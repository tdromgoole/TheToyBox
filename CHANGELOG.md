# Change Log

All notable changes to the "theToyBox" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.9]

- **New Feature**: **GitHub-Style Markdown Alerts** — `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, and `[!CAUTION]` blockquotes now render as styled callout boxes in the built-in Markdown preview.
- **New Feature**: **PHP Function Detection** in Better Outline — PHP functions (`public`, `private`, `protected`, `static`) are now detected and displayed with a Function icon.
- **Enhancement**: **Material Symbols icons** bundled locally — icons in the Better Outline and Markdown alerts no longer require an internet connection.
- **Enhancement**: **Custom Markdown Preview** command (`The Toy Box: Open Markdown Preview with Alerts`) for a standalone dark-themed preview panel.
- **Bug Fix**: Custom comment detection no longer incorrectly flags PHP variable references like `$varName` as custom comments.

## [0.0.8]

- **New Feature**: Added **JSON Formatter** to pretty-print minified JSON selections.

## [0.0.7]

- **SQL & PostgreSQL Support**: Native detection for Tables, Views, Procedures, and Functions in the outline.
